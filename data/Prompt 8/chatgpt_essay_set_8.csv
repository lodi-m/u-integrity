When I was in college, I worked at a gas station. The first time I ever saw a kid run across the street to our store, I was in shock. I couldn’t believe what I was seeing.

Nevertheless, Grandma bubbled with energy and good humor. Every time a new patient or nurse came into the room, she’d greet them with a friendly “Good morning, sweetie!” and a smile. Even though she was in pain and probably couldn’t do much, she still found the energy to make everyone feel welcome. Through her laughter, she showed us all that there’s nothing we can’t overcome – even when things seem pretty bad."

Halfway through the story, one of the kids in the group started laughing so hard his stomach was spasms. It was so contagious that within minutes, everyone in line was laughing too. That brief moment of joy was what pushed my mom and me through the rest of that boring conversation. It was special, because it was the first time I experienced true laughter with someone else.

When I was younger, I used to idolize my older sister. I would do anything that she would do and I would always try to be like her. One day, my sister and I were playing in the living room and she was doing this scary face that I had never seen before. So, I laughed at her and it made her mad. She turned around and shouted at me, “Why are you laughing at me? I’m supposed to be scary.” I told her that I wasn’t laughing at her, I was laughing with her. But, she didn’t believe me and she was really mad at me. After that, I always tried to be more like my other sisters and laugh when they were laughing, even if it wasn’t really that funny."

Once, when I was in high school, I was sitting in the cafeteria with three of my friends. We were all eating our lunches, when one of my friends started getting picky about the sandwich he was eating. He complained about everything from the flavor of the mayo to the type of bread the sandwich was made of. I remember thinking to myself, “This is going to be one long lunch.” 
Sadly, I was right. After about 30 minutes of grumbling, my friend finally threw his sandwich in the trash bin and said, “I’m done with this.”

Just then, one of my other friends started laughing. And then, after a few more chuckles, we all started laughing too.

It was really funny — and it made the lunch hour seem shorter by comparison.

One time my grandma told this story about her childhood. She used to live on a small farm with her family. Her Papa needed the land to work on, so he would leave for days at a time. When he was gone, Mama would take care of the farm. One day, Mama was milking the cows when a car pulled up to the farm. Out jumped a bunch of other kids, all asking Mama if they could milk the cows too. Mama said no and explained that Papa was always gone and she didn't have time to teach them how to milk the cows. The kids were sad, but they understood. A few minutes later, Papa drove back up to the farm. He got out of the car and saw all of the kids playing together. He was amazed. He asked Mama what had happened. She told him that she had said no and explained that she didn't have time to teach the kids how to milk the cows. Papa was so impressed with Mama that he started calling her “grandma milker” from then on. Whenever he went away on business, he would leave his young sons with Mama so she could take care of the farm.

When I was in grade school, I used to have this really tricky teacher. Every day she’d give us a really hard math problem, and unsurprisingly, most of us couldn’t solve it. 
But one day, I got the answer to her problem. And needless to say, when she saw it, she was so astounded that she just started laughing.

In 1987, I was a new doctor in a small town in upstate New York. One of my first patients was a 92-year-old woman who had died the previous year. When I walked into her room, I could tell she had been much loved. All around the room were pictures of her family, some of which she had kept framed. The most touching picture was of her and her husband, both of them beaming with happiness.

As I started to examine her, I could see that she was severely anemic. After discussing her history and symptoms, I told her that I thought she might have a blood transfusion required for her health. She became very upset and said that she didn’t want to go through with a transfusion. I explained that it was the only way for her to be healthy and that she had to agree to the procedure.

Finally, after much reluctance, she consent and I wheeled her into the operating room. As we began the operation, she started to laugh. And laugh. And laugh. I’d never seen anything quite like it. It was as if the transfusion was the best thing that had ever happened to her.

Laughter is one of the most powerful human emotions and it’s important that we use it often. Laughter helps us to connect with other people and it can make us feel happy and fuzzy inside.

When I was in middle school, I was in the library studying for a test. I had headphones plugged into my ears and was doing my best to focus. I was sitting in the back of the library on the floor, so I had to scoot as far away from the door as possible in order to stay warm. There was a large window in front of me that let in a lot of light, so I was able to see the person walking by outside. I was so engrossed in my studying that I didn’t even notice them when they came up to the window and started trying to open it. I was so surprised when I heard the door open and saw the person walking away. I quickly unplugged my headphones, pulled them out of my ears, and turned around to see who it was.

My family and I went on our first camping trip as a foursome. My two brothers and I were so excited to spend the weekend in the wilderness. However, within minutes of setting up our tent, we were faced with a serious problem. Our water supply was right next to our tent and it was full of mosquitoes!
Since we were all so excited to camp, we didn’t want to give up on our trip just yet. We tried to find another water source, but it was tough because there were no trails in the area. After a while, we just gave up and went to bed.
We were all exhausted from walking around in the mosquito-infested area, so we all fell asleep really quickly. 
Hours later, we were woken up by a loud noise. It sounded like someone was banging on our tent! We got up and opened the door to find a large group of ants marching in line next to our tent!
 Needless to say, our camping trip turned into a disaster, and we all laughed our asses off the entire time.

The incident with the ants was funny because it was unexpected. It also showed how over-the-top passionate we can get about things, which is why it was funny. Laughter is an important part of any relationship because it helps reduce stress and makes us feel closer to our friends and family."

Whenever we were conversationless, each of us would seize the opportunity to laugh and lighten the mood. Life would be much harder without laughter."

When my son was very young, he would often put things in his mouth that he shouldn't have. One time he ate a whole can of paint. When my wife and I got home and saw the disgusting paint can sitting in our son's highchair, we laughed so hard. We felt so relieved and happy that our son was fine and that we could just clean up the paint. Laughing was one way that we connected with our son and showed that we loved him."

I once worked at a call center, and one of our main ways of dealing with disgruntled customers was by having them laugh. It usually worked; if the customer was in a good mood, he or she would usually be more willing to try to work out a solution to their problem. Personally, I think it’s important to have at least one source of laughter in your life – it just makes everything feel a little more bearable."

A few years ago, I had the pleasure of hosting a dinner party with some of my closest friends. It was a very special evening and, as always, we laughed until our stomachs ached. Towards the end of the night, I noticed that my husband and son were both looking a bit sad. I asked them what was wrong, and they both admitted that they were missing the laughter of our friends. Even though they didn't live near us anymore, hearing them laugh brought them close to us in a very special way.

It's clear that laughter is a powerful tool for Connection, and it's one of the simplest things we can do to make someone's day. So next time you find yourself struggling to laugh, take a moment to remind yourself that it's worth it."

When my husband and I got married, we knew we wanted to have a really fun wedding. One of the things we work really hard at is making everyone happy. So, when we saw this idea for a wedding where everyone gets Comedy Cake Pops, we knew we had to have them!

I remember when my grandma died. It was tough, but my aunt and I were able to console each other with lots of laughter. We would giggle and chuckle and sometimes even cry, but it was good. It made us feel closer to each other, like we were really okay. She was really the only family I had left, and she was gone, but at least I could still laugh with her."

For me, my family is probably the best example of how laughter can be so important in a relationship. We’re always joking around and making each other laugh. Even when there are disagreements, we can usually come to an agreement by trading funny stories. It’s not always easy, but it’s definitely worth it. Laughing together is probably the best way to build a strong relationship."

One day, my grandmother was sitting in her living room, watching TV. Her cat, Popcorn, sat on the arm of the chair next to her. Popcorn kept meowing, but my grandmother didn’t seem to be getting interested in the show. Finally, my grandmother reached over and petted Popcorn. The show finally ended, and Popcorn got up to go to her food dish. As she walked past my grandmother, she meowed again. My grandmother laughed and petted her again. That simple action - enjoying the company of a loved one, even when things weren’t going well - was really comforting to me."

A few years ago, my best friend, Sarah, and I were having a conversation about our first jobs. Sarah was a intern at a publishing company and I was a clerk at a convenience store.

When I was a kid, my Aunt Bernice always made us laugh. She’d tell jokes, do funny voices, or tell us stories that made us laugh. Even now, her stories make me laugh. Sometimes we’d just sit around and laugh until we couldn’t anymore. But what I remember most vividly is when she’d sit us down and have us do a little acting. We’d have to pretend to be somebody we weren’t, and she’d make us act out the part. We’d have to be the obnoxious best friend, the nosy sister, or the mean girl. And even though we’d usually hate playing those parts, we’d always have a lot of fun.

When we laughed, it felt like we could really connect with Aunt Bernice. And even though we never really saw her that often, her laughter was always a special part of our family."

My grandmother used to tell me a funny story about her grandfather. Apparently, when Grandfather was a young man, he fell in love with a beautiful girl. She loved him back, but he was very poor. One day, she told him that she couldn't continue to date him because he couldn't provide for her. Grandfather turned to her and said, “I can provide for you, but I'll only do it if you will marry me.” To this day, I find that story hilariously adorable."

When I was a kid, my family would go on vacation to the beach every summer. We’d pack up the car, drive for hours, and finally arrive at our beach house. We’d spend the next few days eating hot dogs and playing in the waves.

One of my favorite memories is when my brother and I caught a cone full of sand in our hands. We started laughing so hard that we cried. It was a moment of pure joy and laughter. Even though we were only children, our laughter helped to make our vacation unforgettable."

My grandmother used to tell a story about when she was young. She and her friends would always go out and play, but they always had to be careful not to get lost. One day, they were playing in a park and they got lost. They were getting quite alarmed, but then they heard a laugh. They followed the laugh until they found their way back to the park. Laughter had led them back home! It was a lesson she never forgot.

When I was younger, I always thought that my parents were the funniest people in the world. Whenever I would see them laughing, it would make my day. Even though I’m not always sure what they’re laughing at now, those early memories are some of my favorite.

Laughter is also really important to me as a therapist. It’s one of the things that’s helped me work with a lot of my patients. When they start to feel better, it’s often because they’ve been able to laugh at themselves and their problems."

I usually laugh when I am with my family or friends. Even when something really isn’t that funny, it usually makes me laugh. My dad always says that he laughs because it’s the only way that he can show that he cares. Whether it’s because we’re poking fun at ourselves or because someone else is being hilarious, laughter is definitely incredibly important to our relationships."
