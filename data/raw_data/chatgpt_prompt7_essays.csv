My mom is always so patient with me. We go through so many trials and tribulations as a family, but she never gets too upset or impatient. In fact, she's one of the most understanding people I know. She's always willing to listen, even if she doesn't understand what I'm saying right away. And she never loses her temper, even when things are really tough. I can't imagine going through life without her patience."

Patience is one of the most important things you can have in your life, whether it's in your personal life or your professional life. I remember, as a young adult, I would get so frustrated with my inability to complete tasks quickly. I would rush through them, not giving myself the time to achieve the best results. But, over time, I learned that patience is key to any successful endeavor. If I waited until I was 100% sure I had the task completed, I always ended up with an inefficient and overloaded system. In my personal life, being patient has translated to better relationships. I'm not as quick to judge or react to an issue, which allows the other person to talk more candidly and voila—a more understanding relationship. Overall, I think patience is one of the most important virtues you can cultivate in your life and it has dividends in all areas of your life."

I'm not one for taking things slowly, especially when it comes to food. I love to eat, and I love to eat fast. But that's why I have such an appreciation for patience; most food just tastes better when it's not rushed.
A few months ago, I made the mistake of going out with friends for dinner. We were all starving, so we went to this restaurant that was pretty popular and had a wait time of at least an hour. Normally, I'd be fine with that, but this time, I was really starving and I wanted to eat something fast. So I made a big mistake. I ordered a meal that was really big, and it was really expensive. Not only that, but I ate it really quickly. It was embarrassing, and I'll never make that mistake again.

I grudgingly sat up and reached for my phone, ready to give my boyfriend a piece of my mind for disturbing my sleep. But when I saw the name on the caller ID, my heart melted a little.

I know having patience can be hard, but sometimes it's important to just let things happen their own way.

My grandfather was always one of the most patient people I've ever known. He would sit and watch hours and hours of rain streaming down the window, never getting up to move or complain.

He was always so mentally alert and aware of his surroundings, it was amazing.

By the time she was done, she felt a lot better."

Billy was always one for taking his time. It wasn't that he was always in a rush or anything like that, but he was just really good at bargaining and waiting for the right moment. For example, he would often wait for the other kids on his block to finish playing before starting his own games. Or he would always let the ice cream truck catch up to him before getting a cone.

However, one day, Billy was particularly impatient. He had been waiting for hours for his turn at the basketball court and he was getting really mad. Finally, he called out to the other kids, ""I'm sick of waiting. Let's go.""

The other kids quickly ran over to join Billy and the game started. But surprisingly, the other kids were also really good at waiting. They were able to keep up with Billy for the most part and even managed to score a few baskets in the process.

Eventually, Billy just got tired and gave up. He admitted that he was a little bit too impatient and he learned to be a little bit more patient in the future.

I learned this lesson the hard way. I was always in a hurry and I never lasted long in any game. I would always get banned from playing"

There was once this girl who was always very patient. She never complained about anything, no matter how hard or how long it took. Whenever she had to wait for something, she would sit and wait calmly. She never lost her patience and was always understanding."

When my sister was pregnant, she was very tired all the time. I would help her with her work, but then I would need to rest. Occasionally, she would want to go out with her friends, but I always told her that I wanted to rest. She would often get upset with me, but in the end, she learned to be more understanding.

Eventually, my sister had her baby, and she was so exhausted that she couldn't do anything. I cooked for her and took care of her baby, and she was so grateful. She told me that she never would have been able to do it without my help. It was a lesson that I learned well- sometimes, it's important to take a step back and let others be able to do things on their own."

When I was younger, I always had trouble waiting for things. Sometimes I would be in line for a long time at the store, and when I got to the front, the clerk would say that there was a mistake and I wouldn't get my purchase. Or my mom would be late for dinner, and I would have to wait for her for an hour and a half. I would get really impatient, and I would start to cry.

But now, I'm much more patient. I remember a time when I had to wait in line for hours to see my favorite celebrity. I was so excited and I was calm the whole time. I even  chatted with some of the other fans. It was a great experience.

So, being patient is a great way to handle difficult situations. It can make you feel more calm and in control. And, best of all, it can result in great experiences."

It was only a few minutes until the exam was over, but my hands were shaking so badly I couldn't even scribble my name on the paper. I could feel the other students looking at me, judging me. But I lifted my head and stared straight ahead, trying to keep the calm demeanor I had practiced all morning. Finally, the professor dismissed us and I made my way out of the room, breathing a sigh of relief.

I could have walked home in a straight line, but I decided to take the scenic route. I was so 1898. I passed by a flowing creek, followed by a forest on either side. The sun was setting, casting a beautiful glow over the trees. I could have stayed there all night, but I knew I had to get home. Finally, I emerged from the forest and saw my house in the distance.

It had taken me almost an hour, but I was home safe and sound. I can't say I was particularly patient, but I was definitely patient enough for the situation."

When I was younger, I remember always being impatient. I would always try to rush through everything, and if something came up that I had to wait for, I would get really frustrated. I think it's really important to be patient, especially when things are difficult. You don't want to add to the difficulty, but you do want to get through it as smoothly as possible. Sometimes things will happen that we can't control, and that's when patience is key. You have to remember that things will work out in the end."

Touching down in Las Vegas after a long flight, my husband and I were both exhausted. Our luggage had already been collected and we had just a few hours to kill before checking into our hotel. We walked around the city, taking in the sights and sounds. Later that night, we went out to eat at a restaurant and then hit the casinos. By the time we reached our bed-ridden grandparents’ house in the middle of the night, we were physically and emotionally exhausted.

Despite our exhaustion, we were patient with our grandparents. We explained our situation and asked them if they could help us get some sleep. We were grateful for their willingness to help, and we quickly fell asleep. In the morning, we were able to spend some time with our grandparents and then continue our journey.

Patience is important, especially when dealing with people who are elderly or ill. By being patient, we were able to show our grandparents that we cared about them and that we were willing to help in any way possible."

The day started out like any other. I got up, ate breakfast, and headed to school. But as I walked down the hallway, something caught my eye. There, in the middle of the floor, was a huge puddle.

Knowing that I would have to walk through the puddle to get to my class, I took a deep breath and walked through. As I stepped on the liquid, it squished beneath my feet. I tried not to grimace as I made my way to my class.

Halfway there, I realized that my shoes were ruined. Desperate for a new pair, I turned around and began the trek back to the puddle. As I stepped in, the liquid turned to mud and stuck to my shoes.

By the time I made it back to the puddle, my shoes were ruined and I had to walk back to school barefoot. But that didn't stop me from being patient. I went through the entire day without complaining, even when my feet were sore and blistered.

Eventually, my shoes were fixed and I was able to finish the day without any issues. Because I was patient, I was able to enjoy my day despite the hardship."

When I was little, my mom always told me that if there was something I wasn't able to do, I needed to be patient and wait for someone else to help me do it. Even though I was frustrated, she was right – if I didn't try, I would never learn. I remember one time, I was trying to get a balloon out of a jar using a straw. I couldn't seem to get it far enough down, and my mom was getting really frustrated with me. But she just waited until I was successful and then she helped me put the balloon back in the jar. She was patient, and I learned a lot from her."

Patience is something that I try to be as much as possible. Some days it can be really hard, especially when there's something I want or need and it seems like it'll never happen.

Then, I remembered something my mom always told me: sometimes, the hard way is the best way. I helped my sister try a few different ways to open the package, and eventually she got it open.

My mom is the most patient person I know. She has been through so many tough times, yet she never complains. She has always been stoic and determined, even when things were really tough. She has a lot of patience, and it’s something I admire about her. Whenever we are having an argument, for instance, she will usually try to discuss the issue calmly with me until I am satisfied. Even though I can be quite contentious at times, I know my mother is always trying to understand me.
One time, my family was on vacation and we had to wait in line for nearly two hours to get into the amusement park.

We hadn't seen them there the day before either. We were about to leave when we saw two kids walking away from the spot. They didn't even look our way. We were so frustrated. We tried to find a new spot, but there wasn't one. We were about to give up when we saw a girl walking down the path. She was stopping every few feet to tie her shoe.

Last summer, when I was seventeen, I was working at a summer job in a local garden center. For the first week, I was terrified of the job. The store was huge and it was so noisy and disorganized. I was also new to the area, so I was constantly lost. The boss was really patient with me, though. She would give me little tips about the job and encourage me to keep trying. Eventually, I got the hang of it and I really enjoyed working there.

One day, the boss was out of the store and an employee called me into her office. Without giving me a reason, she told me that I was being let go. I was completely devastated. She had been so patient with me and now I was done. I couldn't believe it. I left the store with my head down, tears streaming down my face. I was so disappointed in myself.

Patience was not always easy for me. In fact, there have been numerous instances where I have griped and complained about trivial things.

Sometimes, people can be really impatient. They can't stand to wait for anything, and they definitely don't like being restrained in any way. This can lead to a lot of frustration and conflict, especially if the person being impatient doesn't usually handle their emotions well.

A few years ago my parents took me on a journey that i never wanted to take. We were going to be camping in the middle of nowhere for 5 days. Since it was my first time camping and also my first time doing anything by myself, I was a bit anxious. Everyday we would set up our tent, put up the food, and then sit around and wait for the sun to go down. But even when the sun was setting and I was getting ready for bed, I would tell myself that tomorrow is a new day and I would get up early and have a great time. 
This trip was a great learning experience for me and I am so grateful that my parents took me. Not only did I learn how to camp and adventurously drive around without a map, I also learned patience. The hardest part of this trip was not being able to complain. The environment was challenging and there were moments of darkness where I felt scared, but I knew that there was a better tomorrow and that I would be able to conquer this challenge."

Patience is a virtue that is often times hard to come by. For me, it is something that I have to work at constantly.

Patience is a virtue that my mother always taught me. But it was hard learned in my youth, as I was constantly impatient and couldn't control my emotions. One instance that stands out most in my mind was when I was in the fourth grade and had to wait in line for a lengthy period of time to get my hands on a new toy. All of the excitement and energy within me kept building until I was vibrating with impatience and fury. By the time I finally got my hands on the toy, I had emotionally destroyed it by being so rough with it. My mother was so disappointed in me and I can still see the disappointment in her eyes. It was a valuable lesson that I learned that day- that sometimes being patient is the best choice."

When my little brother was three years old, he always wanted to do things his own way. He would stack all of his toy cars up until they were taller than he was and wouldn't let anyone take them down. He would get frustrated when we couldn't figure out how to fit through the door or when Mama wasn't paying attention to him.

It took a lot of patience, but eventually we were able to get through to him that it was necessary to follow directions. We taught him how to share and how to compromise, and he became far more cooperative.

My grandmother is one of the most patient people I know. Growing up, I would always see her sitting in the living room, stone-faced and relaxed, while my relatives and I railed on her about our various problems. She would patiently answer every question, never becoming angry or defensive. Even when I was a total annoyance as a child, she never lost her temper with me.

In fact, patience was one of the things that I admired Most about her. I learned from her that you can experience difficulties without raising your voice or becoming bitter. In fact, sitting back and allowing patience to work its magic can often lead to a resolution or solution.

Despite the valuable lesson that I learned from my grandmother, sometimes I find it difficult to be patient. Life is full ofstress and there are always several things vying for my attention. I find it difficult to put my problems and concerns on hold and allow things to work themselves out. But I am always reminded of the importance of patience by my grandmother, and I am grateful for her example."

Patience is something that I struggle with, I think it's one of the things that I'm good at, and one of the things that I need to work on. My patience is tested a lot when it comes to things that I want or need and I find that I get frustrated quickly. 

One time, I had been waiting in line for quite some time at a store and I was really impatient. I was fidgeting, tapping my foot, and talking on my phone. Somehow, the line moved and I was right in front of the cashier. I could tell that she was really exasperated with me and I could tell that she was about to give up on me. But she didn't.

In my life there have been many times when patience has been tested. One of the most difficult times for me was when I was in college.

It’s important to remember that patience is a virtue that is worth cultivating."

Patience is a very important virtue. Especially when it comes to waiting in line or for something that you want. My mom is so patient, she can sit in line for hours at a time and not get impatient. Even when there are long lines at the store, she never gets angry or frustrated. She understands that it's just a matter of time until she gets what she's looking for.

Some other people that I know are also very patient. They won't get angry or upset when things don't go their way. They know that there is always a possibility that something will happen and they will get their desired outcome.

I think that patience is a really important quality to have. It teaches us to control our emotions, and to be understanding of other people. I'm glad to know people that are patient, and to have watched them display this character trait in different situations."

When I was little, my mom used to tell me that patience is a virtue. And she was right. Patience is essential if you want to succeed in anything. You have to be willing to wait for your turn, to persevere through difficult times, and to not get discouraged.
Earlier this year, I finished my first year of college. It was a challenging experience, but I persevered. I worked hard and took the required classes, but I wasn't the only one; there were plenty of other students who were also struggling.
Fortunately, my mom was always there to support me. She was patient with me, even when I didn't understand something, and she was also supportive when I achieved my goals. She showed me that it's important to have patience and to never give up on your dreams."

When my little brother was five, he was constantly climbing into places he wasn't supposed to be. We would be in the kitchen cooking dinner and he would sneak up into the cabinet to get a can of Pepsi. Or he'd hop up onto the counter to get a jar of Nutella. Needless to say, we were always telling him to be careful.

But even though he was risky, patient Ana was always willing to help him out. She would patiently explain to him why he needed to stay out of the cabinet or why he needed to ask first before getting Nutella. And eventually, he learned.

Patience is a valuable trait to have, especially in difficult situations. It can take a lot of perseverance to deal with difficult people or Problems, but the results can be truly rewarding."

I was sitting in my biology lab, struggling through the difficult material. I had been studying for hours, but the questions just weren't clicking. Suddenly, I saw the bell ring, signaling the end of class. My shoulders slumped in relief; I could finally take a break.

As I made my way to the door, I heard someone calling my name. I turned to see my friend, Nadia, sprinting towards me.

""Hey, I just wanted to mention something. I think you're doing great, but be careful - there's one more test tomorrow."" Nadia's words warmed my heart. I knew she was only trying to be helpful, but I still appreciated her offer.

""I'll be fine, Nadia. I know I can handle it."" I leaned in to give her a hug, grateful for her support.

I know I can handle anything because I'm patient."

When I was younger, I didn't always have the patience to deal with things that didn't necessarily interest me. Every once in a while, I would get really angry with things that weren't going my way, even if it was something as simple as waiting in line for too long. But I've learned to be more patient over the years. I've learned that some things are just going to take a little longer than others, but ultimately, they'll get done. I realize that sometimes it may be difficult, but I try to remember that patience is a virtue. It can be difficult to remain patient, but it's ultimately worth it."

A patient woman listened to her friend’s woes for hours on end. She didn’t interrupted or get angry, even when her patience was wearing thin. Finally, her friend ran out of stories to tell and fell silent. The woman let out the breath she’d been unconsciously holding and said, “I’m so sorry. I know how you feel. It’s hard to cope when something’s wrong.” Her friend nodded, looking ashamed. “It is,” she said. “But having patience means bearing the burden for a while. Sometimes it feels like it’s too much, but it’s worth it in the end.”"

They were able to eventually make all the changes they wanted in their lives and they are still living happily ever after."

I often find that my patience is tested in difficult situations. However, I have learned to be patient and overcoming these struggles is ultimately worth it.

Despite the challenges, I tried to be understanding and supportive. I didn't give up on us and we eventually worked through our issues. I know that patience was a key part of our reconciliation."

My grandfather is one of the most patient people I know. Whenever there is a problem, he doesn't get angry or frustrated. He simply takes a deep breath, relaxes his muscles, and waits for things to work out. Even though he doesn't always get what he wants, I know that he always tries his best."

When I was younger, I was always the impatient one. I would pull my hair out or scream at my siblings. I guess I just couldn't handle waiting for things. But over time, I've learned to be more patient. It's not always easy, but it's definitely worth it.
One time, I had to wait for my mom to finish her work at the office. I was really excited to see her, but she was taking really long to finish.

One day I was waiting in line at the grocery store and I got behind a woman who apparently didn't have anything better to do. She was constantly in line behind me, breathing heavily, and grumbling about how much she was going to complain about the wait. After about fifteen minutes, I started to get a little bit irritated. I glanced over at her and noticed that she had gone to the cashier and started to checkout. I was so surprised that she was being so patient. I think that if more people were like her, the lines at the grocery store would be a lot shorter."

Patience is something that I'm definitely not known for. When something bothers me, whether it's a small thing or a big thing, I never hesitate to voice my opinion. I'm always in a hurry, and I can be quite determined at times. That can make things really difficult when dealing with people or situations, because they always seem to take longer than I think they will.

But sometimes I have to remember that things happen in their own time. I shouldn't expect things to happen right away, or even at all. Life isn't a set in stone Hollywood movie where everything always comes together perfectly. In fact, quite often things don't go as planned and we have to deal with the consequences.

But that's how life works. We have to be patient and understanding, and sometimes that takes a little bit of effort on our part. But it's ultimately worth it."

As a kid, I was always impatient. It was really hard to sit through classes, or wait in line, or even just sit quietly for a long period of time. But as I got older, I learned that patience is key.

There were a few times in my life where patience really paid off. For instance, when I was in college, I had to take a lot of math classes. At first, it was really frustrating because the classes were really hard and I was terrible at math. But eventually, I learned to be patient and I really started to excel in the classes.

Another time was when I was working at the seafood market. At first, the job was really tough. I had to wade through all the dirty water, and I had to pick through all the fish. But eventually, I learned to be patient and I was able to excel at the job.

Patience is a virtue that is very important in life. It can be difficult to be patient, but it is important to remember that patience is key to getting what you want. There are many times when we have to wait for something, or someone, and it can be frustrating. But, the key is to not get angry or frustrated. We have to have patience and wait for the situation to come to its final resolution. Sometimes, the wait can be long, but it is worth it in the end.

Often times, it is important to be patient with others. We may not always understand what they are saying or why they are doing things. We have to be understanding and tolerant. This can be hard, but it is ultimately a good thing. When we are patient with others, they will often return the favor. It is a cycle of goodwill that can lead to a lot of positive relationships.

Sometimes, we have to be patient with ourselves. Life can be chaotic and it can be difficult to stay on track. We have to be careful not to get too caught up in the mundanities of everyday life. We have to remember that there is more to life than just our routines and tasks. We have to take the time to"

When I was young, I didn't have much patience. I would get angry quickly and couldn't control my temper. It was never fun when I got mad, and I definitely didn't have any tolerance for anyone who didn't meet my standards.

Thankfully, I've grown a lot as a person since then. I now know that times will always be difficult, but I need to remain patient. I need to remember that people are always doing their best and that there is no need to rush things.

Looking back, I realize that patience was the key to my ongoing success. If I had never been patient, I would have given up on my dreams long ago. I would have been living a life that I never wanted and that wasn't anywhere near as fulfilling as the one I have now.

So lesson learned, everyone: patience is key! And remember, if you're having a hard time managing your anger, reach out to someone you trust for help. It's never too late to learn how to be a better person."

Patience is a virtue that is required in many aspects of life. Sometimes, it can be difficult to maintain patience and to not get angry when things don't go the way we want them to. However, patience is a key ingredient for success and it is something that is often rewarded with positive outcomes. In my opinion, patience is the most important virtue because it allows us to control our emotions and to be able to think rationally.

There was a time when I was very impatient and I struggled to be patient. It was difficult because I was usually very emotional, and I didn't like waiting. In fact, waiting was one of the worst things that could happen to me because it made me anxious and stressed. However, I eventually learned that patience is important, and that it is sometimes the key to achieving our goals.

In his early twenties, Gyula had never ridden on a bus or a train. All he knew was how to navigate his bike through the city streets. Riding the bus was a totally new experience for him. For the first time, he needed to get up early in the morning and wait in line for a long time, until he finally got on the bus. He had to be patient, and not get impatient, even though it seemed like the bus was taking forever to get to his stop. 

A few weeks later, Gyula decided to try riding the train for the first time. He was there for what seemed like hours, but in reality it was only a few minutes. He had to be patient, and not get impatient, no matter how long it took. He was amazed at how smoothly the train ride went, and how quickly he arrived at his destination."

Patience is a virtue that is often underrated. It's difficult to be patient when things are going wrong, but it's important to remember to be understanding. My grandmother was truly a patient woman. Even though she had a lot of frustration with the world, she never showed it to us. She would sit494 for hours on end, waging her own internal battle, waiting for her turn in line or for her child to come home from school. She constantly reminded us that there would be time for everything. She never complained, even when the line at the grocery store was long or the traffic was bad.

Patience is something that I have had to practice a lot in my life. When I was younger, I had a hard time sitting still for extended periods of time. I always wanted to be moving and doing something.

I kept checking the website and the message board to see when they said it was done. I waited until they said it was ready, but when I got there, they said it still needed some work. I was disappointed, but I understood. I went back home and waited a couple more days. The car was finally ready, and I was so happy! I couldn't believe it! I think being patient paid off in the end.

Patience is Definitely Valuable
I don't think it would be possible to have a healthy life without it. Sometimes things can be frustrating, and it feels like we can't move forward until everything is just right.

Patience is something that I am definitely not known for. When things get really tough, I often find myself yelling or just giving up. But, that's not always the best solution. I learned this the hard way one time when I was waiting in line at a store. I had been there for what seemed like forever and I was getting angry.

When I was little, my parents always said that if I did something I wasn't supposed to, I had to be really, really patient. They would tell me to sit down and not get up until I was told to, and most of the time, I would listen. I knew that if I didn't, they would get really angry with me, so I always tried to be patient.

It was always harder when I was trying to do something that I really, really wanted to do. For example, if I was playing with my friends and I wanted to go over to the other side of the playground, I would have to be really patient and wait for my parents to say okay. But if I was at home by myself, I could usually get what I wanted pretty easily.

Now, being patient isn't always easy. Sometimes I feel like I can't stand waiting, especially if I'm waiting for something that I really want.

Sometimes it would take a really long time for anything to happen. But, I learned to be patient. I would sit there and listen to music or read a book, or anything to keep me busy. Sometimes, things would happen really fast, and I would be really anxious. But, I learned to be patient, and it all worked out in the end. I'm now a confident person, and I know how to handle difficult situations. Even though things don't always happen the way I want them to, I know that I can always withstand the challenge."

My grandfather was always so patient. He had a lot of Perspective, always handling difficult situations with aplomb. Even when he was sick, he never complained. In fact, he often took the time to explain things to my grandmother in a way she would understand. Even when I was a child, I could see the patience he had. It was a quality I wanted to cultivate in myself. I knew that being patient wasn't always easy, but it was worth it.

I remember going to the store with my grandmother. We were running late and the line was long. My grandfather took a deep breath and walked forward. I was amazed at his patience. He didn't get angry or frustrated, he just kept moving forward. Even though the line was long, my grandmother and I were able to get what we needed.

Patience is a valuable trait, and my grandfather is a perfect example of it. I try to practice it when things are tough, and I know it can make a big difference."

Learning to be patient is a valuable skill that can be used in many different situations. One time when I had to be patient was when my parents put me in timeout for not doing my homework. Another time when I had to be patient was when I was waiting in line at the store. Finally, my friend Lauren always has to be patient with her little brother."

Sherrington was babysitting for the day and something always seemed to get in the way of her fun. Pouring Ovaltine into her Kinder egg wasn't enough, she also had to deal with a fussy little toddler throwing a fit whenever he didn't get his way. Just when she thought the day couldn't get any worse, her older sister called and asked her to come over and watch her kids. Sherrington hesitated, she didn't want to add another hour to her already long day. But soon enough she realized that she couldn't resist a chance to spend some quality time with her family. So she picked up the phone and gave her sister a quick excuse. In the end, it was worth it to her to be patient and spend the afternoon with her loved ones."

Patience is a Virtue

The virtue of patience is something that can be hard for some people to learn. It can be difficult to handle difficult situations or to remain calm when things aren't going our way. But patience is a valuable virtue, and it is something that is essential for success in any area of life.

There are times when patience is definitely required. For example, if you are waiting in line at a grocery store, you may have to wait for a very long time. If you are waiting for your turn in a game of tennis, you may have to wait for a long time before you can actually play. In these cases, patience is definitely important.

But sometimes patience is not necessary. For example, sometimes you can just walk away from a situation if it is not going to work out. Sometimes you can persistence and wait for the right time to breakthrough a barrier. And sometimes, you just have to give up and move on. These situations, too, require patience.

Once upon a time, a princess was visiting a crowded city. She wanted to take in as much as she could, but she was also very impatient. She would walk up to people and try to take their picture, even if they weren't particularly interested. It quickly became clear that she was not going to be able to see as much as she wanted if she was constantly running around.

One day, while she was walking through the city, she happened to come across a boy who was being very patient. He was sitting on the ground with his legs stretched out in front of him, and he was drawing with a pencil on a newspaper. She was astounded by his restraint and how easily he seemed to be capturing the cityscape.

She soon learned that the boy was named Tim and that he was an artist. She was so impressed by his work that she bought a copy of his book. She learned that he was always prepared to take the time to capture the beauty of his city, even if it took a little longer. She was inspired by his patience, and she started to see things in a new light.

Tim is a great example of patience. He is able to find beauty in even the most challenging situations. He"

When my younger sister was about to get married, I was really excited for her. It had been a long time coming and I wanted her to find the love of her life and start her own family. Though we were close, I knew that she would be going through a lot on her big day- things that I couldn't even imagine. On the day of the wedding, she called me frantically to tell me that her dress was ruined. Essentially, she had picked it out the night before the wedding and it had started to rain. Needless to say, her dream wedding was quickly turning into a nightmare. My heart went out to her, but I understood that she had to be patient. She and her husband ended up having an amazing ceremony in spite of the disaster that was her dress. It was a moment that I will never forget and I am grateful that my sister was able to be so patient on that day."
