Dear [local newspaper],

I believe that computers have a positive impact on society. They teach people how to use their hands, give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people, and even allow people to talk online with other people.
Other experts are concerned, however, that people are spending too much time on their computers and not enough time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends.

I believe that people should use their computers to their full potential, but they should also take time for other activities that are important to them. I hope that [local newspaper] agrees with me and shares my opinion with its readers."

Dear Editor, 

There is a lot of debate in the modern world about whether or not computers benefit society as a whole. I believe that they do indeed have a great impact on people, teaching them important things such as hand-eye coordination, allowing them access to information they wouldn't be able to find anywhere else, and even allowing them to connect with others online. However, there are still some people who are worried that people are spending too much time on their computers and not enough time doing things like going outside, exercising, and enjoying time with family and friends. I believe that these people are short-sighted and need to take a look at the bigger picture. Overall, I think that computers are a great tool that can help people learn and grow faster than they would if they were just stationary."

Hello,

I hope you are well. I am writing to express my concerns about the growing reliance on computers in our society. I believe that this reliance is having a negative effect on the general welfare of our citizens.

First, I think that computers are detrimental to hand-eye coordination. They are teaching people to use their hands incorrectly and to be neurologically addicted to screens. This is not good for the development of fine motor skills or the coordination of the entire body.

Second, I believe that people are spending too much time on their screens. We used to spend time outdoors playing with our children, talking to our friends, and enjoying the beauty of nature. Now we are spending our time in front of screens, instead.

Third, I think that computers are not good for our mental health. They are teaching people to become addicted to screens and to become isolated from the rest of society. We used to enjoy interacting with our family and friends, but now we are too busy looking at screens to spend time with them.

I believe that these are all negative effects of the growing reliance on computers in our society. I want to encourage you to write articles about the dangers of computers, and to raise awareness about the consequences of our addiction to screens. I hope that you will consider my concerns and publish my letter."

Hello!

As a person who spends a lot of time on computers, I believe that they have a lot of positive effects on society. First of all, they teach hand-eye coordination, which is important for people who want to be successful in life. Many jobs, such as being a doctor or a computer scientist, require excellent hand-eye coordination.

Second, computers allow people to learn about faraway places and people. For example, you can learn about the Egyptian pyramids by visiting the website Ancient-Egypt.com. This website has information about the pyramids, including the height, the layout, and the history of each one.

Another example is the website about the Titanic. You can read about the Titanic and the people who were on it by visiting the website Titanic-History.net. This website has videos, photos, and other information about the Titanic.

Finally, computers allow people to talk online with other people. For example, you can talk to your friends in your hometown by going to the website Facebook.com and clicking on the “Facebook” button."

Dear Editor, 
I disagree with those who argue that computers have a negative effect on people.
In my opinion, computers have many benefits for those who use them. For instance, they teach hand-eye coordination, allow people to learn about faraway places and people, and talk online with other people.
While it is true that people are spending less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends, I believe that this is a small price to pay for the many benefits that computers provide. 
I urge you to stand up for the positive effects of computers and to encourage people to use them in their everyday lives. Thank you."

Recently, more and more people have started using computers. Some believe that this is a good thing, teaching people hand-eye coordination, learning about faraway places, and allowing people to communicate with others online. Others are concerned that people are spending too much time on their computers and not enough time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends. 

I believe that computers have a positive effect on people, and I think that people should continue using them."

Dear News Editor, 
As a computer user myself, I believe that they have a very positive effect on society. They allow people to learn about faraway places and people, to communicate with others online, and to exercise their hand-eye coordination. On the other hand, some experts are concerned that people are spending too much time on their computers and less time interacting with family and friends. I hope you will take this into consideration when making your editorial decisions. Thank you for your time."

They provide people with the ability to learn about faraway places and people, as well as allow them to talk online with other people. These are all things that can help people increase their knowledge and connect with others. I believe that people should spend more time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends, instead of spending all their time on their computers. Thank you for reading my letter and I hope you agree with me."

Dear Newspaper Editor, 

I always enjoy reading your opinion pieces and I was particularly interested in reading your article on the effects of computers on people. 

I believe that computers have a very positive effect on people; they teach hand-eye coordination, allow people to learn about faraway places and people, and even allow people to talk online with other people. I think that people are spending too much time on their computers and not enough time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends.

Dear Newspaper Editor,

I hope that you are well. I wanted to write you and express my opinion on the effects of computers on people.

I believe that computers have a very positive effect on people. They teach hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people, and even allow people to talk online with other people. In addition, people can now work from home, which is great for families.

However, there are some people who are concerned that people are spending too much time on their computers and less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends. I think that this is a mistake. If people spend too much time on their computers, they will not be able to develop their hand-eye coordination, learn new things, or make friends online.

I hope that you agree with me and that you will write articles discussing the positive effects of computers on people. Thank you for your time."

Dear Editor,

I am writing in response to the recent article about the positive effects of computers on society. I wholeheartedly agree that computers have positive effects on people, and I believe that people are spending too much time on their computers and not enough time interacting with family and friends.

Dear local newspaper,

When I was a kid, I used to love going outside and playing with my friends. But now, because so many kids are glued to computers all the time, I hardly ever see them. I'm not saying that computers are bad per se, but I do think that they have a negative effect on people.

Computer use teaches hand-eye coordination, lets people learn about faraway places and people, and enables people to talk to one another online. But in the meantime, kids are spending less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends. I think that society as a whole would be better off if computers played a smaller role in our lives."

Dear Editor,

As a computer user myself, I believe that their are numerous benefits to society from advances in technology. For one, computers teach hand-eye coordination and give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people. Additionally, they allow people to talk online with other people, enhancing social interactions.

However, not everyone is convinced that these benefits outweigh the potential negatives of spending too much time on computers. Some experts are concerned that people are spending too much time on their computers and not enough time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends.

I believe that computers have a profoundly positive effect on society, and I urge the readers of your newspaper to agree with me. Thank you for your time."

However, I do have concerns about the way computers are currently being used. Too many people are spending too much time on their computers, rather than spending time out in the world interacting with others. I believe that people need to spend more time exercising and enjoying nature, in order to keep their bodies healthy and their minds sharp. I hope that my letter will help to open people's eyes to the importance of taking time for themselves, and help them make better decisions about how to use technology in the future.

I believe that advancements in technology, such as computers, have a very positive effect on humanity. They help people to learn how to use their hands more efficiently, learn more about different cultures and people, and even allow people to interact with one another online.

Thousands of people are spending too much time on their computers and not enough time interacting with each other.
